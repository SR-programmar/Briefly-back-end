- This contains the back-end processes for the Briefly Chrome Extension.
- The job of this server is to make API calls to a LLM from OpenAI
- This server was made using the Flask Python Framework.
- It's deployed using a hosting platform called [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## What it does

The server takes input from Briefly such as a webpage or user prompt, pre-processes it, and sends it to OpenAI. It then takes the response generated by the Artificial Intelligence, and sends it back to the Briefly Chrome extension. This process utilizes JSON Object, a type of format used to transmit data over APIs and servers.
